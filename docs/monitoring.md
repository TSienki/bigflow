# Monitoring

The easiest way to monitor your processes is to use Cloud Composer [DAG metrics](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/monitoring-dashboard?&_ga=2.137435509.-47150562.1597392349#dag_runs).

To set up an alert for a metric, go to the Cloud Composer dashboard and open the "Monitoring" section:
