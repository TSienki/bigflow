# Development

## Branching

We use the [GitFlow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) branching strategy to develop BigFlow.

## Releases

We use 3 kinds of releases:

* `major.minor.devX` – development releases, for testing purposes
* `major.minor.rcX` – release candidates, tested in a real project
* `major.minor.patch` – standard release, ready to be use in production

## Development process
